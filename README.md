# IP Address Tracker

This web app works by entering an IP address or domain in the search field, then it retrieves and displays information
about it from [ip-api](https://ip-api.com/) and pinpoints its location on the map.

## Demo

You can try the game yourself by visiting the [live demo](https://ip.humbertoaxl.dev/).
